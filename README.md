# gitPractice

Its the first time that i am working with CMD for git commands.
I am using CMD as well as Git Bash.

I am enjoying it.

I think its only "git push" Not "git push origin master".

No, you have to give the full command "git push remoteName branchName".
Otherwise that will not be accepted.

Final and the genuine answer: You don't have to give "origin master" if it's a cloned repository from 
GitHub because "git clone" automatically adds the remote "origin".
If u have a local folder and transformed it to Repo then that is necessary.


## Practice makes everyone perfect.

About "git commit"
	You have to use "-a" and -m "commit message" if the file being worked is not added to staging area
where
	-a = for all files in the working directory
	-m = for the commit message or comment

If u wanna add only few files to the repository,then add those to the staging area.
By using " git add" command and finally commit.
