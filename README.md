# gitPractice

Its the first time that i am working with CMD for git commands.
I am using CMD as well as Git Bash.

I am enjoying it.

I think its only "git push" Not "git push origin master".

No, you have to give the full command "git push remoteName branchName".
Otherwise that will not be accepted.
