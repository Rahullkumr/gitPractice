# gitPractice

Its the first time that i am working with CMD for git commands.
I am using CMD as well as Git Bash.

I am enjoying it.

I think its only "git push" Not "git push origin master".

No, you have to give the full command "git push remoteName branchName".
Otherwise that will not be accepted.

Final and the genuine answer: You don't have to give "origin 
							  master" if it's a cloned repository from GitHub.
							   If u have a local folder and transformed it to Repo
							   then that is necessary.


Practice makes everyone perfect.
